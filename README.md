RINE (Responsive is not enough)
=============

Firstly written as a call for a better UX into mobile development, RINE is a disruptive approach for multi-platform development that fills the gaps left - or created - by Responsive Web Design (RWD).

Its philosophy is to unify desktop and mobile development to deliver a unique user experience depending on the device you are browsing with.

It's a design system and a framework.
